In this code function:

    The problem of calculating the nth Fibonacci number with def keyword, if else branching, base case, recursive case etc. is divided into 
    two sub-problems: calculating the (n-1)th Fibonacci number and calculating the (n-2)th Fibonacci number.

    TNow, these sub-problems are further subdivided into smaller problems until they reach the base cases, where the solutions are straightforward (F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1).

    Once the base cases are reached, the function combines the solutions of the sub-problems to obtain the solution for the original problem (F(n)).

So, each call to the function divides the original problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems until they are solved directly, and then combines these 
solutions to solve the original problem. This aligns with the divide-and-conquer paradigm, making it an example of such an algorithm.
